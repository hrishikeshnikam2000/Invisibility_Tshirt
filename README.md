# Invisiblity_Shirt

The aim of making this was to emulate a fun see-through project where we can see through the T-shirt worn by the person in front on the camera.

It's like putting on a tshirt through which you become invisible, and we can see what's behind the person wearing it.

It is built using the following libraries.
  
        OpenCV
        numpy
        time
        
        
Please install the required libraries.


Designed for red color beacuse i was wearing a red tshirt while writting code for it.
